# The Basics

This TTRPG uses three 6-sided dice, which will be shown as "3d6" here on. You use these dice to roll everything in the game.

When you need to roll a skill skill or attribute, roll 3d6 and **roll under or match** the **target** to succeed.

There are some special circumstances for specific rolls:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>3-4</td>
    <td>Critical Success</td>
	<td>*except*</td>
	<td>if the target is</td>
	<td>3-4</td>
	<td>then it's a success.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>17-18</td>
    <td>Critical Failure</td>
	<td>*except*</td>
	<td>if the target is</td>
	<td>17-18</td>
	<td>then it's a success.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>*under target*</td>
	<td>Critical Success</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>*over target*</td>
	<td>Critical Failure</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Success & Failure Margin
**Success Margin** is the amount you beat your target by. Some actions may use this for various effects.

If your Success Margin is 10 or higher, you get a Critical Success.

Ex. If the target is 8 and you roll a 5, the Success margin is 3.

**Failure Margin** is the opposite, the amount you failed your target by, and is used by various effects.

If your failure margin is 10 or higher, you get a Critical Failure.

Ex. If the target is 8 and you roll 10, your Failure Margin is 2.

## Criticals
**Critical Success** is a very good possible result.

**Critical Failure** is a very bad possible result.

Criticals occur either when the Success/Failure margin is 10 or higher, or when you reach the edges of what you can roll with 3d6 (3-4 for Critical Success, 17-18 for Critical Failure).

Sometimes the rules will specify the effect, sometimes it's up to your GM.

Criticals will often be shortened to "Crit".

## Contests
**Contests** are when two characters must roll, and whoever rolls a better Difference Margin wins.

Difference Margin is the difference in Success Margins between you and your foe during a contest. Some actions use this for various effects.

If both people fail, the winner is the person with the smaller Failure Margin.

## Take 3
**Take 3** is an option when you have a roll to do, but choose to take ×10 the time *typically required*, to act as if you had rolled a 3.

Anything that cannot be done in under ×10 the typical time does not allow you to Take 3.

## Division
Whenever a value of any kind is divided, round in the direction that benefits the "most involved person".

Examples:

Damage from attacks usually rounds up, as the attacker is more actively involved than the defender.

Damage from poison usually rounds down, as the sufferer is currently more involved than the poisoner.

## Modifiers

The GM decides the value of situational modifiers, but this can be difficult if you're new to the system.

This table will help you understand how to weigh a modifier. It is by no means a rule, simply a guideline.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>+8</td>
    <td>Extremely Easy</td>
    <td>Paper Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+6</td>
    <td>Very Easy</td>
    <td>Cardboard Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+4</td>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>Fiberboard Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+2</td>
    <td>Somewhat Easy</td>
    <td>Damaged Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>Plywood Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-2</td>
    <td>Somewhat Hard</td>
    <td>Oak Wood Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-4</td>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>Reinforced Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-6</td>
    <td>Very Hard</td>
    <td>Stone Door</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-8</td>
    <td>Extremely Hard</td>
    <td>Iron Door</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Values do not have to be on steps of 2, that's simply for clear visualization. Values are not limited to the range of this table.

**GMs:** Remember that rolling 3d6 creates a bell curve of result chances- The edges (3, 18) are much rare than the middle (10, 11). This means a modifier of -4 is more than twice as punishing as -2.
