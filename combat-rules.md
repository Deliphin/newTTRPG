# Combat Rules
In combat, each character gets a turn every round.<br />
One round is how long it takes for every character to take their turn.
One turn is 3 seconds. Some actions such as charging spells may take up multiple turns. If an action is not a single Standard Action, it will specify.

## Initiative
Initiative determines turn order.  
If a character wishes to move anywhere down in the initiative order, they may do so freely. If they move below a foe however, they may not move back above that foe unless that foe moves below the character.

## Action Types

### Standard Action
All actions are Standard Actions unless specified otherwise.\
Examples: Swing a sword, cast a spell, pull something from a backpack, equip a gauntlet, look for a hidden foe.
During any Standard Action except for any form of Move, as long as you're not restrained (such as by grappling or rope), you are *always* allowed to move 1 hex. This includes All-Outs other than All-Out Move.

### Quick Action
Quick Actions are actions you can take in the same turn as a Standard Action. You may do one per turn. You may also trade your Standard Action for an additional two Quick Actions. These Quick Actions are still considered a single Standard Action.
Examples: Nock an arrow, cock a gun, pull something from your bandolier, speaking with sign language.

### Free Action
Free Actions are actions that cost no time, or can be done simultaneously with a Standard Action. You can only do one of each Free Action once per turn.
Examples: Speaking verbally, telepathically speaking, triggering an implant, switching a gun’s fire mode, and more.

### All-Out Action
All-Outs are actions that give you a defense penalty*, as you are completely dedicated to the action.
All-Outs are always Standard Actions.
All-Outs are always treated as their non-All-Out equivalent- effects that apply on Attacks also apply to All-Out Attacks.
\*Exception: All-Out Defend spends your turn defending. The penalty for that is that you’re not using your turn on something else such as attacking.

## Common Actions

### Wait
Hold your action until something happens.
Wait is a Quick Action.
You state what your Standard Action will be, and it will be a reaction to what someone else does. If they don’t do it, you lose your Standard action.

### Perform
Other actions not described elsewhere.
Examples: Unsheathing a sword, reloading a gun, flipping a table, climbing a rope, setting a fire, using a computer.

### Move
Move up to Move ×1, and/or change Stance.
You must move from Prone to Kneeling before moving to Standing, but you can drop from Standing to Prone immediately.

### Concentrate
Concentrate on a mental task. If your concentration is interrupted (You make a defense, are injured or are otherwise distracted) roll INT-3 to maintain your concentration.
What you roll against depends on what you’re concentrating on. Magery spells roll against INT.

### Aim
Line up your shot at your target.
Ranged weapons only. Aim is a Concentrate, and its interruption rules apply.
Add the Accuracy bonus from your weapon to your next attack. If you do not attack the turn after, you lose the bonus.
Do not roll for Aim, it always succeeds.

## Common Combat Actions

### Attack
Attack a single foe.
Roll the relevant skill as it describes. If you succeed, TODO.
Requires your chosen weapon be readied. Casting spells falls under Attack, even if it’s a support spell cast on friendlies.

### Disarm
Remove a foe’s weapon.
Disarm is an Attack.
Roll normal attack, with penalty. Penalty depends on their weapon’s reach. Reach 1 is -4, each additional reach reduces this penalty by 1.

### Shove
Push a foe back.
Shove is an Attack.
Roll the highest of AGI or any Wrestling to hit.

### Move And Attack
In one action, move up to Move ×1, and attack at -3 to hit.
Move and Attack is both a Move, and an Attack.
If you miss your attack, roll AGI to avoid tripping. If you fail, you fall down a Stance. Crit fail drops you to Prone.
The attack can be before, during or after the move action.

### Charge
Run through a foe.
Charge is a Move And Attack.
Roll against the higher of DX or Brawling to hit. The -3 to hit for Move And Attack does not apply.
Damage is (your Speed × CON). You can reduce your effective Speed to a minimum of 1. If the target makes any All-Out Defend, you take half the damage.
You must have enough Speed to move at least 2 hexes past your target’s position.
If you fail, you move 2 hexes past your target.
If you hit a wall, TODO.

### All-Out Move
Sprint to your destination.
Move up to Move ×2, and/or change Stance.
All-Out Move cannot be taken if you are Prone.

### All-Out Defend
Defend with a selected bonus.
    Guard        +2 to defense rolls.
    Double       Twice the defenses.
	
### All-Out Attack
Attack with a selected bonus, and lose your defense.
    Determined   +4 to hit. Only +1 for ranged.
    Strong       +1 damage per damage die.
    Double       Twice the attacks.
    Feint        Fake an attack. TODO
	
### Full-Auto Attack
Full-Auto Attack is an Attack.
Full-Auto Attack can only be done with ranged weapons.
Some weapons can fire in full-auto, which allows firing multiple rounds in one attack. Choose how many shots to fire.

**Single-Target**
Roll to hit one target with all of the shots. Any misses become part of a Full-Auto Attack (Cone) that you must do, and does not consume your Standard Action.

**Cone**
Roll damage first. Roll to hit every character, friendly included, who is in a Tight Cone in the direction you’re firing, in order of closest to furthest.
Every hit consumes two shots fired. If you run out of shots fired, stop rolling to hit targets.
