# newTTRPG

Are you looking to cast a fantastical spell to save a rifleman from a being crushed by a giant mech?
Are you looking for just some standard fantasy roleplay? Or just a guerilla warfare combat game? Or a space opera?
Are you looking for something you can feel comfortable publishing your own works for?
This tabletop roleplaying game is intended to support all of that, and more.

What makes this TTRPG able to support all of this?
Characters are built on XP, which is spent for ability scores, skills, traits, and classes. One resource to do anything with your character. Want a proper jack of all trades? Put most of your points into skills. Want a glass cannon? Put most of your points into a couple powerful traits or your attributes.
