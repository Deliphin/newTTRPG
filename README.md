Are you looking to cast a fantastical spell to save a rifleman from a being crushed by a giant mech?

Are you looking for just some standard fantasy roleplay? Or just a guerilla warfare combat game? Or a space opera?

Are you looking for something you can feel comfortable publishing your own works for?

This tabletop roleplaying game is intended to support all of that, and more.
